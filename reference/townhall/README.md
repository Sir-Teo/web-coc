# Native Town Hall catalog

Pinned public client 18.400.21, bundle `7f04bdfdc4124b1f49308423bb8f4aa8b137aae3`, downloaded from `https://game-assets.clashofclans.com/`. This reference holds the tier tables the Home Village progression is built from. It contains no artwork; the buildings it gates own their own art and combat references.

- `catalog.json`: 18 Town Hall tiers with their original hitpoints, gold price, build duration and permitted count of every entity this game implements; the Town Hall each individual building and trap level requires; the complete per-level rows of the entities no other reference owns; all 110 Barbarian King records; the gem price of each Builder's Hut; and what a new village is granted.

The signed files have a 68-byte signature header followed by the client LZMA payload, as recorded in [KING-COMBAT.md](../../docs/KING-COMBAT.md). Downloads use normal HTTPS certificate verification.

## Reading conventions

Three different inheritance rules apply and are expanded before anything is written.

- In `townhall_levels.csv` each tier is its own single-row record. A blank count means *unchanged from the tier below*, so counts carry forward across records, not within one. The importer additionally requires every count to be monotonic.
- In `buildings.csv` and `traps.csv` a blank cell inherits from the previous row of the same named record. `TownHallLevel` is the Town Hall that permits that level, so `X-Bow` levels 1–3 reading `9` is the complete Town Hall 9 ceiling.
- The Town Hall's own rows are offset: row 9 carries `TownHallLevel` 8, because Town Hall 9 is what a Town Hall 8 village builds. The importer asserts that offset rather than assuming it.
- `globals.csv` is a flat `Name`/`NumberValue` sheet with no continuation rows at all, so none of the three rules apply to it. `WORKER_COST_2ND` through `WORKER_COST_5TH` give the gem price of each Builder's Hut after the first — 0, 500, 1,000 and 2,000 — and `STARTING_GOLD`, `STARTING_ELIXIR` and `STARTING_DIAMONDS` what a new village is granted.
- `heroes.csv` stores the *next* upgrade's price and duration on the current-level row, so `catalog.json` converts them into destination-level records. `RequiredHeroTavernLevel` is the Hero Hall. Activation recovery is joined from `special_abilities.csv` through each row's `SpecialAbilitiesLevel`; the King's `BarbarianKingAbilityHeal` levels 5, 6 and 7 heal 450, 525 and 625.

Reproduce with any Python 3.11+ interpreter; this importer needs no third-party packages:

```sh
python3 scripts/import-native-townhall.py --check
```

This re-downloads the pinned tables, verifies their SHA-256 values and requires the committed JSON to match byte for byte.

## Scope

Counted and gated names are restricted to the entities this game implements. Buildings the game has no model for — Dark Barracks, Siege Workshop, Pet House, the Builder Base roster and later defenses — are deliberately absent and are not silently treated as zero-count content. The catalog records what the original client permits; which of it the home village actually offers is a separate decision recorded in [TOWNHALL-TIERS.md](../../docs/TOWNHALL-TIERS.md) and `src/game/progression.ts`. The counts this game hands out differently below Town Hall 9 are listed in that document. Hitpoints, prices, durations, storage capacities and every per-level row here drive the running game.
