# Original Archer Tower source foundation

Captured from public client 18.400.21, bundle `7f04bdfdc4124b1f49308423bb8f4aa8b137aae3`, at [the original asset host](https://game-assets.clashofclans.com/7f04bdfdc4124b1f49308423bb8f4aa8b137aae3/fingerprint.json).

`scripts/import-native-archer-tower-source.py` pins SHA-256 for the fingerprint, building, projectile, effect and emitter tables, and independently verifies each table's SHA-1 membership in that fingerprint. `--check` reconstructs the complete document and compares it byte for byte.

The capture preserves all 21 raw tier rows and inherited tier records, 10 referenced projectile definitions (including alternate variants), 7 effects with recursive spawned effects, and 11 particle emitters. Source fields and units remain strings, without inferred timing, projectile trajectories or alternate-mode arithmetic. Level 15 specifies 1,230 HP, 85 DPS, a 500-ms attack interval and range 1000 source units; alternate fields separately specify 200 DPS, 250 ms and range 800. The level-15 regular and alternate body exports and projectile names remain distinct.

Importer reconstruction and the focused source test pass. This is a definition capture, not an artwork or combat integration. Original scene graphs, textures, resident archers, projectiles, effects, timings and mode behavior still require implementation and qualification. Midnight Oil remains gated by Archer Tower level 15 and Inferno support. No runtime behavior or home progression changes in this commit.
