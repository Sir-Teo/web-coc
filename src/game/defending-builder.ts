/**
 * Defending Builder: the character each armed Builder's Hut (source levels 2+) sends out to repair.
 *
 * Source (pinned rows): `Builders Hut` levels 2–4 name `DefenceTroopCharacter=Defending Builder`,
 * `DefenceTroopCount=1` and `DefenceTroopLevel` 1–3 (1-based, as the older
 * LogicDefenceUnitProductionComponent's `SetUpgradeLevel(level - 1)`). The character rows give
 * Speed 250, AttackRange 50, AttackSpeed 750, a negative DPS (-50/-60/-70: HP restored per
 * second), IsJumper, HP 100,000+ and `DeathShowTimeMS=1` with an empty death export. Globals:
 * `HEAL_STACK_PERCENT` 100,100,90,90,70,40,10,0 and `ALLOW_REPAIR_AFTER_DAMAGE_TICKS` 0.
 *
 * Engine (older pinned-generation client, see reference/garrison/README.md):
 * - LogicDefenceUnitProductionComponent.Tick spawns each defence troop on the first battle tick at
 *   `(GetX(), GetY() + height << 8)`: the building's left edge, vertical middle.
 * - LogicHitpointComponent.CauseDamage gives each healer one of eight slots per target (held
 *   1,000 ms after each heal) and scales the heal by `HEAL_STACK_PERCENT[slot]`; a target at 0 HP
 *   is never healed, and hit points are clamped to the maximum.
 *
 * Behavior (public documentation):
 * - [Supercell, Battle Builders](https://supercell.com/en/games/clashofclans/blog/game-updates/battle-builders-2/):
 *   he repairs nearby buildings, cannot be damaged or targeted by attacking troops, stops once his
 *   own hut is destroyed, and a Lightning Spell resets his repair target.
 * - [House of Clashers, Battle Builder](https://houseofclashers.com/home-village/defenses/battle-builder):
 *   repairs only within 4 tiles of his hut; when the hut collapses he runs back and hides.
 * - [Fandom, Builder's Hut](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Builder's_Hut) (wikitext): he repairs
 *   any damaged building except Walls while his hut stands, keeps one building until it is
 *   destroyed or fully repaired, defensive Rage raises repair and speed, Invisibility hides
 *   buildings from him, and several Builders on one building lose up to 10% (five Builders).
 * - Local: the most damaged candidate (lowest hit point fraction, then nearest, then ID); the radius
 *   is measured from the hut center to the building footprint; repairs use the split attack timer
 *   (200 ms windup, 550 ms recovery for healing rows).
